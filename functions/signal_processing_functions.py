def apply_butterworth_filter(data, n, wn, btype, hz):
	"""
	Butterworth digital and analog filter design.

	Design an Nth-order digital or analog Butterworth filter and return the filter coefficients.

	See https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.butter.html

	Parameters
	----------
	data: np.array(n_samples, axes)
		numpy array with acceleration data (each column represents an axis)
	n : int
		the order of the filter
	wn: np.array(1,2)
		A scalar or length-2 sequence giving the critical frequencies. For a Butterworth filter, this is the point at which the gain drops to 1/sqrt(2) that of the passband (the “-3 dB point”).
		For digital filters, Wn are in the same units as fs. By default, fs is 2 half-cycles/sample, so these are normalized from 0 to 1, where 1 is the Nyquist frequency. (Wn is thus in half-cycles / sample.)
		For analog filters, Wn is an angular frequency (e.g. rad/s).
	btype: ‘lowpass’, ‘highpass’, ‘bandpass’, ‘bandstop’}
		The type of filter. Default is ‘lowpass’.
	hz 	: float
		The sampling frequency of the digital system.

	Returns

	data_filtered : np.array(n_samples, axes)
		numpy array with filtered acceleration data

def resample_acceleration(data, from_hz, to_hz, use_parallel = False, num_jobs = cpu_count(), verbose = False):
	"""
	Resample acceleration data to different frequency. For example, convert 100hz data to 30hz data.
	Enables upsampling (from lower to higher frequency), or downsampling (from higher to lower frequency)

	Uses the resampy python module.
	see: https://github.com/bmcfee/resampy

	Smith, Julius O. Digital Audio Resampling Home Page Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA), Stanford University, 2015-02-23. Web published at http://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/resample/.

	Parameters
	----------
	data: np.array
		numpy array with acceleration data, can be more than one dimension
	from_hz: int
		original sample frequency of the data (this is usually the frequency the device was set to during initialization)
	to_hz : int
		the sampling frequency to convert to.
	use_parallel : Bool (optional)
		if set to True, then individual axis will be processed in parallel to speed up computational time. Defaults to False
	num_jobs : int (optional)
		if 'use_parallel' is set to True, then 'num_jobs' defines how many parallel jobs are executed at the same time. This typically is the number of
		hyperthreads. Also note that for triaxial data, even if n_jobs > 3 axes, it can only process 3 at the same time.
	verbose : bool (optional)
		if set to True, then output debug messages to console and log file.

	new_data : np.array
		new numpy array with resampled acceleration data
